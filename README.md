# TAMA Project "Runnoff App"

This project was developed as final project for the course Python Programming for Water Resources Engineering and Research
TAMA project is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) based on the netcdf file provided in GRUN platform by [ETH Zurich](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/324386)
GRUN: an observation-based global gridded runoff dataset from 1902 to 2014).

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for testing purposes. 
Get ready by cloning the exercise repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Tlanezi/1st-Repo.git

### Prerequisites
*Python* libraries: *tkinter*, *numpy*, and *pandas*.
Install create a new environment and install flusstools

```
-m pip install flusstools
```

Also is required to install a netcdf reader

```
-m pip install netCDF4
```

**F**inally is requiered for you to **d**o**w**n**l**o**a**d the data (Zip format) from [GRUN dataset from 1902-2014](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/324386)
It is important not to change the name of the document once downloaded
